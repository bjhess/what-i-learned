### [Scoring Predictions](http://practicingruby.com/articles/58)

This was a great example of how to analyze technical interview
solutions. Our the iterators streamlined?

The big takeaways here:

1. BDD should help you write code. Not be busy work.
2. Extra iterations is a sign of the wrong iterator.
3. Tracking indexes or variables also a sing of the wrong iterator.
4. `case` is often just another `Array`.
5. Write code to communicate to the reader. Figure out the underlying meaning.

Learned about a couple enumerable methods: [`zip`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-zip) and [`chunk`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-chunk). "If you find yourself in these scenarios, go spelunking in Enumerable to see if there's a better tool for the job."
