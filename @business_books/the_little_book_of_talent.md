I enjoyed the quick stories and tips in this book. Lots of interesting details about how some of the big talent-forming organizations do things a little differently than you're used to. I think it could be really useful not just for building one's own talents, but for helping others, like your children, work on their talents. Noting down some of the tips in the three sections of the bookâ€¦

### Getting started

* `#4` Buy a notebook. Write stuff down and reflect on it. A notebook creates clarity.
* `#5` Be willing to look stupid. Encouraging reaching. Interpret mistakes as information used to navigate to the correct move.
* `#7` Hard skill vs soft skill. Hard skills should be performed as correctly and consistently as possible (e.g. shooting a free throw, basic math, etc). Soft skills have many paths to a good result (e.g. attacking a weakness in a soccer defense, subtle changes in a musical performance to highlight emotion, etc).
* `#8` Build hard skills carefully, like a carpenter.
* `#9` Build soft skills with play, like a skateboarder. Take a high number of varied reps, and get clear feedback.
* `#10` Prioritize hard skills. The fundamentals.
* `#12` Finding a teacher: someone who scares you, someone who gives short, clear instructions, and someone who loves teaching fundamentals.

### Improving skills

* `#13` The "Sweet spot" is somewhere between being very comfortable and holding on for survival. You know the goal and you really have to reach for it. It might take a few failures to get there.
* `#14` Practice toward a number of high quality repetitions, not against a clock.
* `#15` Break skills down into chunks and try to master a new chunk every day.
* `#18` Practice daily rather in occasional chunks. It's better for forming neural connections and it develops good habits.
* `#19` Gamify mundane activities.
* `#32` Focus on the positive move. Don't focus on the mistake you are trying to avoid.
* `#33` To learn from a book, don't read it four times. Read it once and then write a summary.
* `#38` Stop practicing before you're exhausted.
* `#41` End a practice session on a positive note.
* `#42` Be a better teacher: Use the first few seconds to connect on an emotional level, deliver vivid chunks of information not long speeches, use precise visual language, make a scorecard for learning, maximize how much one needs to reach in practice, create independent learners.

### Sustaining progress

* `#43` Embrace repetition.
* `#44` Have a blue-collar mindset. "Inspiration is for amateurs.)"
* `#45` For every hour of competition, spend five hours of practice.
* `#46` Don't try to break bad habits. Form new ones.
* `#47` To learn more deeply, teach.
* `#49` When you get stuck, make a shift.
* `#50` Cultivate your grit (perseverance and self-discipline).
