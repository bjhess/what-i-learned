##### Introduction

> The number of bugs programmers introduce into programs has remained constant for the past forty years. Despite advances in programming languages, techniques, project methodologies, and so on, the defect density had remained fairly constant. [2]

##### Chapter 2: Journey from Novice to Expert

> Use rules for novices, intuition for experts.

Interesting discussion on the differences. Rules and quick wins for novices is huge. Rules degrade expert performance. [25-28]

Novice > Expert:

* Rules > Intuition
* Considers everything > Relevant focus
* Detached observer > part of system [28-29]

Using the Dreyfus Model Effectively:

* Agile methods promote feedback in team. Half the battle.
* Other half is accepting responsibility.
* Help raise skill levels with good exemplars: learn by watching and imitating.
* Keep practicing in order to remain an expert. [31-38]

##### Chapter 3: This Is Your Brain

What you think about the brain's capabilities physically affects the "wiring" of the brain itself. Just thinking that your brain has more capacity for learning makes it so. [71]

It's sort of like refreshing dynamic RAM. Want to be a better coder? Practice config more. [71]

##### Chapter 4: Get in Your Right Mind

In fact this [rock-climbing] instructor really did the correct thing: he provided us with a safe environment in which to explore (remember, he made sure everyone’s safety gear was correctly fitted and adjusted before turning us loose). He first presented us with a multisensory, experiential context [(30 minutes of untrained rock climbing)] so that we could “get our heads around it,” as it were. Then he followed up with a more traditional, fact filled lecture. [81]

Blogging as Men of Letters [98]

Morning pages: daily, before any other activity, 3 pages, hand-written [98]

Write down all subproblems. Solve the easiest ones. Pick the unsolved next easiest, bear it in mind, and go for a walk. Don’t actively think about the problem as L-mode will take over. Bear it in mind and the solutions may just appear. [100-102]

Talk about how novices latch on to code style because easy. Advanced beginners push back because they feel it is a waste of time. Proficients and experts do want the style consistent so their brains can focus on other pattern matching. 

“If you’re at the higher skill levels and you’re encountering resistance from the rest of the team, understand that they literally don’t see it in the same way you do. They won’t automatically appreciate the value; you’ll have to explain it to them. [103-105]

##### Chapter 5: Debug Your Mind

About letter writing vs email. Act like you're evolved: breathe, don't hiss. [139]

Lead with intuition, follow up with proof. You might feel in your gut that an algorithm is the right way to go. Now prove it. [141]

Your expectations of your teammates, boss, or clients will bias your perceptions. And others' expectations of you will color their perception. [143]

##### Chapter 6: Learn Deliberately

Pragmatic investment (in yourself) plan: [155]

Have a concrete plan: next action, goals for next year, goals for five years.
Diversify: learn some high risk things, which might have high reward.
Active, not passive, investment: deliberately stop and evaluate your “portfolio.”
Invest regularly (dollar-cost averaging): commit to invest a minimum amount of time on a regular basis. Ritualize and form a habit. Plan _before_ you get to the time to invest.

Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning modes. [158]

Facets of intelligence: kinesthetic, linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal. [161]

Research has shown that study groups are definitely the “real thing” in terms of learning. [164]

SQ3R (survey, question, read, recite, review) deliberate reading [167]

Survey: scan table of contents and chapter summaries.
Question: note any questions you have.
Read: read in entirety.
Recite: summarize, take notes, and put into your own words.
Review: reread, expand notes, discuss with colleagues.

Mind maps to explore and find patterns in information. [171-178]

NEXT TIME YOU READ A BOOK COMBINE SQ3R AND MIND MAP. Mind map your notes. In review phase, redraw and revise your mind map. [175]

Exploratory mind maps. First iteration really quickly. Let it sit as information comes in. Let it get messy. Only later redraw and revise. [175-176]

Documentation, consider the value of the _documenting_, not just the output. [179]

Learn by teaching. Medical school mantra: See it. Do it. Teach it. [181]

Teaching colleagues, novices, mind-mapping technical talks, giving talks, or writing blog posts are all teaching opportunities. [182]

##### Chapter 8: Manage Focus

Meditation. [214]
