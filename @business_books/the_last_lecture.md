(If you’ve never watched that video, make time in the next week or two. If you have Amazon Prime and a Kindle, borrow the book.)

Here are some small snippets that struck me as I read:

Fundamentals. Pausch’s youth football coach: "How many men are on the football field at a time?" "Eleven on a team, so that makes twenty-two." "And how many people are touching the football at any given time?" "One." "Right! So we’re going to work on what those other twenty-one guys are doing." Pausch goes on: "That was a great gift Coach Graham gave us. Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. As a college professor, I’ve seen this as one lesson so many kids ignore, always to their detriment: You’ve got to get the fundamentals down, because otherwise the fancy stuff is not going to work.

How well do you know your daily toolset? How well do you programmers know your standard library and framework calls? How much more effective could you be if you worked on fundamentals for a few hours every month?

On being criticized: "When you're screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they've given up on you."

On meeting William Shatner: "Shatner was the ultimate example of a man who knew what he didn’t know, was perfectly willing to admit it, and didn’t want to leave until he understood. That’s heroic to me. I wish every grad student had that attitude."

On obstacles: "The brick walls are there for a reason. They’re not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They're there to stop the _other_ people."

On positive framing: "I watched Dr. Wolff use semantics to phrase whatever he could in a positive light. When we asked, 'How long before I die?' he answered, 'You probably have three to six months of good health.' That reminded me of my time at Disney. Ask Disney World workers: 'What time does the park close?' They're supposed to answer: 'The park is _open_ until 8 p.m.'"

On magic memories: "At Christmas, I had made an adventure out of putting the lights on the tree. Rather than showing Dylan and Logan the proper way to do it – carefully and meticulously – I just let them have at it haphazardly. However they wanted to throw those lights on the tree was fine by me. We got video of the whole chaotic scene, and Jai says it was a 'magical moment' that will be one of her favorite memories of our family together."

Time is finite. Manage it well:

* Time must be explicitly managed, like money.
* You can always change your plan, but only if you have one.
* Ask yourself: Are you spending your time on the right things?
* Develop a good filing system.
* Delegate.

"Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think."

On vacationing: "Take a time out. It's not a real vacation if you're reading email or calling in for messages."

On a former student helping bring programming to girls: "Now a computer science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Kelleher is developing new systems that revolutionize how young girls get their first programming experiences. She demonstrated that if it is presented as a storytelling activity, girls become perfectly willing to learn how to write software. In fact, they love it. It's also worth noting that it in no way turns the boys off. Everyboyd loves telling stories."

On possibility: "Men first walked on the moon during the summer of 1969, when I was eight years old. I knew then that pretty much anything was possible. It was as if all of us, all over the world, had been given permission to dream big dreams."

On earnestness: "'Hip' people love parodies. But there's no such thing as a timeless parody, is there? I have more respect for the earnest guy who does something that can last for generations, and that hip people feel the _need_ to parody. When I think of someone who is earnest, I think of a Boy Scout who works hard and becomes an Eagle Scout."

On complaining: "Too many people go through life complaining about their problems. I've always believed that if you too one-tenth the energy you put into complaining and applied it to solving the problem, you'd be surprised by how well things can work out. Complaining does not work as a strategy. We all have finite time and energy. Any time we spend whining is unlikely to help us achieve our goals. And it won't make us happier."

On getting along in a group: "Find things you have in common: You can almost always find something in common with another person, and from there, it's much easier to address issues where you have differences."

On experience: "Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted."

On shortcuts: "A lot of people want a shortcut. I find the bet shortcut is the long way, which is basically two words: work hard."

On tricking people into doing something painful: "I'd send a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints with every paper that needed to be reviewed. 'Thank you for agreeing to do this,' I'd write. 'The enclosed Thin Mints are your reward. But no fair eating them until you reviewed the paper.'"

On time travel: "I've often carried a crayon in my shirt pocket. When I need to go back in time, I put it under my nose and I take a hit."

On parenting: "As I see it, a parent's job is to encourage kids to develop a joy for life and a great urge to follow their own dreams. The best we can do is to help them develop a personal set of tools for the task."

On taking care of oneself: "When we become physically or emotionally run down, we can't help anybody else, least of all small children. So there's nothing weak or selfish about taking some fraction of your day to be alone, recharging your batteries."

On TV: "I'm not a fan of TV – it's mankind's greatest time-waster."

Also, he loved old-fashioned, pen and paper thank-you notes. Me, too!
