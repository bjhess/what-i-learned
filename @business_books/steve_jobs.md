### Quick Review

It was daunting at first, such a long book about Jobs. About half way through things started rolling. I would like to read a book that is a bit more in tune with the technical achievements of Jobs's history. For instance, NeXT is kind of brushed off and minimized when it really is the basis for the operating system I use and enjoy every single day.

### Notes

(Interesting hunks I highlighted on Kindle.)

At peak times during the 1970s, the classified section of the San Jose Mercury carried up to sixty pages of technology help-wanted ads. [42]

Bud Tribble: “We said to ourselves, ‘Hey, if we’re going to make things in our lives, we might as well make them beautiful.’” [123]

Jobs went a bit over the top making the insides of his computers as beautiful as the outside. The better lesson, I think, is to carry the aesthetic all the way through to the underlying code. [133]

I'd love to see this (wait, [I can](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVtxEA7AEHg)!): The high point of the October 1983 Apple sales conference in Hawaii was a skit based on a TV show called The Dating Game. Jobs played emcee, and his three contestants, whom he had convinced to fly to Hawaii, were Bill Gates and two other software executives, Mitch Kapor and Fred Gibbons. [159]

Amen: One of Jobs’s great strengths was knowing how to focus. "Deciding what _not_ to do is as important as deciding what to do,” he said. “That’s true for companies, and it’s true for products.” [336]

On introducing products that damage the standing of your already existing products: you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will.” [408]

On story telling and the Stanford commencement speech: Alex Haley once said that the best way to begin a speech is “Let me tell you a story.” Nobody is eager for a lecture, but everybody loves a story. And that was the approach Jobs chose. “Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life,” he began. “That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.” [456-457]

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. [457]

The idea for the iPad actually came before, and helped to shape, the birth of the iPhone. [467]

Jobs to Rupert Murdoch: "The axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you’ve cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you’re not careful.” [508]

I found this visit during Jobs's sickness … surreal: Early one afternoon Gates drove to Jobs’s house, walked through the back gate to the open kitchen door, and saw Eve studying at the table. “Is Steve around?” he asked. Eve pointed him to the living room. [553]

On technologists job to simplify things for the masses: "They're busy doing whatever they do best, and they want us to do what we do best. Their lives are crowded; they have other things to do than think about how to integrate their computers and devices.” [563-564]

Finally, perspective: I asked how it really felt to be relinquishing control of the company he had built, his tone turned wistful, and he shifted into the past tense. “I’ve had a very lucky career, a very lucky life,” he replied. “I’ve done all that I can do.” [559]
