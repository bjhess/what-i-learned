Everyone wants to learn as part of their job.

Three years in, one hits a brick wall. Give an opportunity to look at things beyond where you are now. This indicates using new tech to solve problems as the using of new tech might be an end in itself.

### Phase 1: Building Credibility

* Don't wait for permission – take ownership of your culture
* Think opportunistically – get some victories
* Quick returns
* Focus on improving people in their primary roles
* Did: meetups, new hire buddies, internal blogging, lunch workshops, screencasts, cross-team code reviews, open book policy
* --- we have new hire buddies, blogging, open book buying policy, talks over the internet
* ** Talks Over the Internet should be more
* ** Screencasts: what about a video showing how I fixed a little-worked on part of the system?
* ** We could try cross-team code reviews
* ** We could encourage buying books more

###Phase 2: Expand Reach & Create Impact

* [What does it look like](http://monosnap.com/image/3eRgMyxkkrlsqDVQEDKTNQm2TSRLbH.png)?
* Start to anticipate needs.
* Opportunities that take longer to payoff start to be possible
* Cross-training **JS** different types of engineers
* Did: host meetups, speak at them, half-day internal workshops, conferences, dedicated onboarding process, weekly tech talks, new hires as buddies
* **weekly tech talks (they do 15 minutes x 4 per week - they have like 100 engineers)
* **workshops (lunch, half-day)
* **or what about online presentations from respected industry people.
* **onboarding
* **speaking
* **we already conference
* **interns and intern new blood code reviewing
* Have to be able to show the investment is paying off

### Phase 3: Shift the culture

* Learning is part of the job.
* Momentum and reputation sustain new efforts.
* New and existing engineer training.
* Active chaos of new ideas. It's a good problem, but you will have lots of experiments being implemented.
* Can try riskier things without destroying momentum.
* Did: Dedicated training (6 weeks when starting), OSS, Apprenticeships (6 months concentrated learning), Sabbaticals, Code spikes / 20% time / exploration, Mentoring as job requirement
* Apprenticeship - twice the culture fit of everyone else, but not even junior programmers. two buddies, three managers, pair with everyone. Huge payoff.
* **Topics outside of software
* **Dedicated training
* **OSS
* **Sabbaticals
* **Experimental, throw-away code
