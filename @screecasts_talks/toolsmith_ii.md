If we recognize our artifacts as tools, we test them by their usefulness and their costs, not their novelty.

We tend to forget our users and their real problems, climbing into our ivory towers to dissect tractable abstractions of those problems, abstractions that may have left behind the essence of the real problem.

The most important of these defenses are a continual focus on our users and a continual evaluation of our progress by their success.

If indeed our objective is to build computer systems that solve very challenging problems, my thesis is that _intelligence amplifying_ systems can, at any given level of available system technology, beat _artificial intelligence_ systems. That is, a machine _and_ a mind can beat a mind-imitating machine working by itself.

His section about the negatives of TV is pretty compelling.
